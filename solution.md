# [JDLT](https://jdlt.co.uk) full-stack developer challenge

We're hoping to see how you approach a challenge and what sort of standards you use in your code so please feel free to be as creative as you like.

The [job spec](https://jdlt.co.uk/join/full-stack-developer) will help you understand what we'd like to see.

## Dependencies
* NPM / Yarn
## Instructions
From the project root folder:
```
$ npm install
```
OR
```
$ yarn
```
Then it's over to you!

**Please demonstrate:**
* Selecting suppliers and products in the drop-downs
* A round-trip to a server pulling back prices
* Displaying the returned data in the grid
* Anything else you'd like to show us

### Sample data

| Supplier    | Product      | Price (Â£) |
| ------------|--------------|-----------|
| New Co Ltd  | Small wongle | 5         |
| New Co Ltd  | Large wongle | 8         |
| New Co Ltd  | Super wongle | 12        |
| Old Co Ltd  | Mini wongle  | 4         |
| Old Co Ltd  | Small wongle | 6         |
| Old Co Ltd  | Large wongle | 9         |
| Old Co Ltd  | Super wongle | 13        |

# Installation / Run / Test

## Install the program

* Clone the repository on your local machine
* From the terminal, navigate to the project root
* Type

```
$ npm install
```
OR
```
$ yarn
```

## Run the application

* Type "yarn start" to run the server
* Navigate to http://localhost:4000/

## Test the program

* Type "yarn test" to test the program
* Type "yarn coverage" to get a code coverage report

# Solution

The program is written in JavaScript and is run in Node.js environment.
The main script is located in "src/app.js".
The "src/demo.js" simulates a call from an external module and is used here to run the demo program ("yarn start").
The "test" folder contains the test script. Mocha and Chai here are used respectively as a test runner and an assertion library.

# If I had more time...

## Future features

1. Although it in not an explicit requirement, I would have add command prompts to allow the user to choose the location of the files to be converted from the terminal.

2. Add a warning and a loading loop (i.e. ".", "..", "...") when the file to read exceeds a certain size (e.g. > 200MB)

3. Add some logic to ensure the "inputFile" format is correct (e.g. make sure each line follows the structure given in the structure file format)

4. Work on this requirement: "strings columns may contain separator characters like ',' and then the whole string needs to be escaped with " (double quotes). Only CR or LF are forbidden"

## Future Tests

Test coverage => 74% (industry standard is 85%).

1. Add tests to ensure errors are thrown if the input file format is wrong.

2. Add a test to ensure program handle special characters.
